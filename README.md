# WELCOME
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my github page! Glad you could make it! I have lots of projects but unfortunatly never seem to finish them! If you have a knack for finishing unfinished buisiness feel free to complete the remaining work on my public projects and take complete credit. All of the public projects are just meant to help me explore new languages / libraries and I can almost always garentee that there is something to be improved upon.
